Single Machine
--------------

Simple A-Priori algorithm which generated frequent itemsets for the given test data. Code is in src/main/python/apriori.py
 

Map-Reduce Implementation
-------------------------

Implemented in Java as it uses Hadoop's map-reduce implementation and the code would be in src/main/java. The Project uses Maven
to compile and build the java code. The jar can be built by running 'mvn clean install package -DskipTest' to generate the
cmpt741-jasneet-michael.jar and dependency_jars in the target folder.
